The main file here is "search-prototype.ipynb". What this file does is it gets the data off of the NamUs missing person dataset. 
Once it gets it, it asks the user for input information of a loved one they know that is missing. Those values will be searched in the database, and 
it will return those cases that have the same values. 

The file "search-missing-db.ipynb" is cleaning and exploring the columns that are used in the main file. Once those columns were clean and ready to be searched,
they are exported to the main file "search-prototype.ipynb".
